## What is OGC?

- Open Geospatial Consortium defines standards for the geospatial industry
- Members are software companies, universities and government
- Such as WMS, GML, OGCAPI, EPSG, GeoSPARQL
- Read more at <https://opengeospatial.org>


## OWS vs OGC API

- The GML and OWS standards are defined on 20**
- Since then the internet moved away from xml
- in 2017 started `spatial data on the web` experiment with W3C, leading to **OGC API**
- Currently under development 
- Basic support in new and existing products
- The browser as a tool to browse spatial data

## OWS vs OGC API

- GML - GeoJSON (json-fg) & HTML
- Long querystrings - Rest api (path parameters)
- GetCapabilities - Open API Specification
- Format=xxx - Content negotiation (accept:text/html)
- Full featured - Minimal standard with extensions

## WFS and OGC API - Features

- Provides access to vector features. 
- Filter, sorting and pagination options

![wms](../img/wfs.jpg)

## WMS and OGC API - Maps

- Image rendering of subsets of the data using some styling rules

![wms](../img/wms.jpg)

## WMTS, TMS and OGC API - Tiles

- Image or vector representation in tiles on a grid

![wms](../img/tiles.png)

## WCS and OGC API - Coverages 

- Grid extracts and calculations

![wms](../img/wcs.jpg)

## CSW, OGC API - Records and STAC

- Catalogue records
- STAC and OGC API - Records both based on OGC API - Features

## Mapserver

- Recent versions of Mapserver support the old and new standards
- Features and Maps 
- No tiles (mapproxy), No coverages yet 
- No records/stac, by design

## Mapfile

- Configuration via a [mapfile](https://mapserver.org/mapfile/)
- All [gdal formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector) supported
- Create mapfiles using QGIS with [geocat bridge](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/geocatbridge/)

## Sensorthings API

- Soil profile data is observation oriented (iso28258)
- [Sensorthings API](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sensorthings/) (STA) is an OGC specification for sensor data exchange
- [Frost server](https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/) is an implementation of STA
- Limited availability of clients for STA, Qgis has a [STA plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SensorThingsAPI/)

## Cloud optimised

- Recent interest in cloud optimised and cloud native formats
- Large data files are places in a cloud bucket, users request subsets of the file using [range requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving)
- For grids, [Cloud Optimised GeoTiff](https://www.cogeo.org/) (COG) and [GeoZarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec) (cloud native)
- For vector, [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/)

## Sematic web

- To integrate spatial data in the web of knowledge, semantic web standards are relevant
- DCAT for metadata
- GeoSPARQL to define geometries
- SOSA for sensor data
- [GLOSIS Web Ontology](https://github.com/glosis-ld/glosis) is a soil ontology based on SOSA and GeoSPARQL
